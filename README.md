# Dar Blockchain Test
Solidity smart contract for a dynamic NFT using the Ethereum Blockchain.

## Description

The NFT changes it's metadata according to the weather.
* If the temperature is under 10C, we get a "pensive" emoji ðŸ˜”
* If the temperature is over 20C, we get a "grinning squinting" emoji ðŸ˜†
* Else we get a "slightly smiling" emoji ðŸ™‚

The contract is deployed at: [0x04f5F947296E181Ea92a7cC5796a14a04A47e67f](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x04f5F947296E181Ea92a7cC5796a14a04A47e67f) on the Goerli Testnet. This one is already funded with LINK Tokens.
